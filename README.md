Create a Bank Management System which has Multiple tables and
relationships between the tables depending on the constraints which
we are passing to connect the different tables. By using this database
we will retrieve the information of particular customers and
employees who are working in the bank. 
In this database, we will
create a view also for a customer and the employees in the bank.

The Bank wants to build the database for their customer and
employees with all the details like creating an account in a bank type
of account which helps the bank to retrieve the data on one click so
they can find out the day to day update easily on their database.

In this project, you have to build the database from scratch by using all
the languages in SQL.
First, you have to create an ER Model of the
data and check the connection was correct or not also apply some all
the keys in the ER Model and then go to the next step which is creating
your own schema with name bank and start creating a table as per
they required 
Here I share a table and the details.
Proposed Solution
1. Create an ER model
The first step is to create an ER model of the data. This will show the relationships between the
 different tables in the database. 
2. Create the tables and relationships
Once the ER model is complete, the next step is to create the tables and relationships in the database.
 This can be done using SQL commands.
3. Populate the tables with data
Once the tables are created, the next step is to populate them with data. This can be done by importing data from a 
CSV file or by entering it manually.
4. Create views
The bank wants to be able to create views of the data in the database. Views can be created using SQL commands.
5. Secure the database
The bank wants to secure the database by using encryption. This can be done by using a tool like MySQL Workbench
6. Use SQL to interact with the database
The bank wants to be able to use SQL to interact with the database. 
This will allow them to retrieve information about their customers and employees, create views, and secure the database.
7. Monitor the database
The bank wants to monitor the database to ensure that it is running smoothly and that the data is secure. 
This is just a proposed solution. The specific steps that need to be taken will vary depending on the specific requirements of the bank.
