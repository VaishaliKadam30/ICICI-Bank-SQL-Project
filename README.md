# ICICI-Bank-SQL-Project
Create a Bank Management System which has Multiple tables and
relationships between the tables depending on the constraints which
we are passing to connect the different tables. By using this database
we will retrieve the information of particular customers and
employees who are working in the bank. 
In this database, we will
create a view also for a customer and the employees in the bank.

The Bank wants to build the database for their customer and
employees with all the details like creating an account in a bank type
of account which helps the bank to retrieve the data on one click so
they can find out the day to day update easily on their database.

In this project, you have to build the database from scratch by using all
the languages in SQL.
First, you have to create an ER Model of the
data and check the connection was correct or not also apply some all
the keys in the ER Model and then go to the next step which is creating
your own schema with name bank and start creating a table as per
they required 
Here I share a table and the details.
